# RSAS
RSAS stands for Resovior Safety Alert System.

This is an IoT Device Application. The system proposes an array of sound and light sensors aroung the resovior facility. The sound sensors are directed towards the water table, and is to detect the splash sound when an animal / human jumps or falls into the water, and alert the ststem.

The light detection system works at night, when there are unauthorized activity by vechile lights, torches, etc to detect with sound sesnors as well.

This is a very serios problem since trapped and dead animal, along with unauthorized humna activity can pollute and harm the water table, and in turn the supply to a whole idutstrial area / city space.
